Reactpress is built upon the awesome [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) for Server Side Rendering.

## Gettings started

### 1 - Wordpress : Make sure CORS are enabled on your Wordpress

Reactpress is only your **front-end**. It's up to you to install Wordpress as you would usually do. reactpress is relying on [REST API v2](http://v2.wp-api.org), which is automatically enabled since Wordpress 4.7 ðŸ˜Š. CORS are special HTTP headers that allows us to pull data from wordpress server API. You can add this to your wp-config.php to make sure CORS are enabled.

```php
// allow CORS
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
```

### 2 - Install Reactpress

```sh
# install dependencis
npm install
# start the dev server on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev
```

### 3 - Add your wordpress api to reactpress.config.js

By default, reactpress uses a demo API. To connect your own API, edit **reactpress.config.js** file and edit variable **wordpressApiUrl** so that it points to your wordpress API. Don't forget the **wp-json** at the end of the url.

```js
module.exports = {
  wordpressApiUrl: "https://dev-reactpress.pantheonsite.io/wp-json"
};
```

You can now start hacking / editing files from _themes/starter_ directory !
